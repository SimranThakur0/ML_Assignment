# Key Findings from Customer Insights Task
 
### 1. **Most Profitable Customer Segments**
   - The most profitable customer segments are those categorized as "Premium" buyers, specifically in the **YOUNG SINGLES/COUPLES** and **MIDAGE SINGLES/COUPLES** groups. These segments contribute significantly to the total sales when compared to their "Budget" counterparts.
   - **Hypothesis**: Premium customers tend to make larger, more frequent purchases, and their preference for higher-end products suggests a greater willingness to spend on quality.

### 2. **Top 3 Best-Selling Products**
   - The top 3 best-selling products are:
     1. **Natural Chip Company SeaSalt175g**
     2. **CCs Nacho Cheese 175g**
     3. **Smiths Crinkle Cut Chips Chicken 170g**
   - These products are consistently purchased across customer segments and have high total sales figures.
   - **Hypothesis**: These products are likely well-known, affordable, and satisfy a broad range of customer preferences, making them popular across both "Budget" and "Premium" buyers.

### 3. **Customer Loyalty and Transactions**
   - **Premium Customers** exhibit higher transaction counts and spend more per transaction than **Budget Customers**. This shows that loyalty and spending power are closely linked.
   - **Hypothesis**: Loyal customers, especially in the Premium category, are driven by brand trust and product quality, resulting in higher frequency of purchases and larger basket sizes.

### 4. **Insight for Marketing Strategy**
   - The marketing department should focus their efforts on **Premium Customers**, particularly in the **YOUNG SINGLES/COUPLES** and **MIDAGE SINGLES/COUPLES** segments, as they represent the highest revenue contributors.
   - A tailored approach targeting product preferences (like chips and snacks) for these segments could further boost profitability.

By focusing on these insights, the marketing department can optimize their campaigns to focus on the most profitable customers and products, enhancing overall sales and customer retention.
